# MMG Dynamics and Abkowitz Model for Ship Maneuvering (v2.0)

This package implementation provides standard models for ship maneuvering:
1.  **MMG Standard Model**: Based on Yasukawa & Yoshimura (2015), suitable for ocean-going vessels with extensions for wind, current, and shallow water.
2.  **Abkowitz-Type Model**: Based on Yang & el Moctar (2024), tailored for inland barges operating in shallow water.

## ⚠️ API Change in Version 2.0
**Important:** Version 2.0 introduces a breaking API change. The package now supports multiple dynamics models. You must instantiate a specific model (MMG or Abkowitz) before calling simulation steps. The old top-level `pstep()` function has been moved to methods within these model classes.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nikpau/pymaneuvering
```

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is by using the `Vessel` dispatcher with a pre-calibrated vessel type from `VTYPE`.

### 1. MMG Model (Ocean-going)

The MMG model requires propeller revolutions (`nps`) as a control input alongside the rudder angle (`delta`). It supports wind and current disturbances.

```python
import math
from pymaneuvering import Vessel, VTYPE

# 1. Initialize an MMG model (e.g., KVLCC2 Tanker)
vessel_type = VTYPE.KVLCC2_L64 # or KVLCC2_FULL
vessel = Vessel(new_from=vessel_type)

# 2. Set initial state
pos = [0.0, 0.0]        # North, East [m]
psi = 0.0               # Heading [rad]
uvr = [3.85, 0.0, 0.0]  # Surge, Sway, Yaw Rate [m/s, m/s, rad/s]

# 3. Simulate one step (pstep returns updated state)
new_uvr, new_eta = vessel.pstep(
    X=uvr,
    pos=pos,
    dT=1.0,                 # Time step [s]
    nps=4.0,                # Propeller revs [1/s] (REQUIRED for MMG)
    delta=10 * (math.pi/180), # Rudder angle [rad]
    psi=psi,
    water_depth=None,       # Optional: shallow water correction
    w_vel=10.0,             # Optional: Wind speed [m/s]
    beta_w=math.pi,         # Optional: Wind direction [rad]
    fl_vel=None, fl_psi=None # Optional: Current
)

print(f"New Position: {new_eta[0:2]}")
```

### 2. Abkowitz Model (Inland/Shallow Water)

The Abkowitz model for inland barges is designed for shallow water operations. It **does not** use `nps` (propeller RPM). Instead, the vessel's surge velocity (`u`) is the primary longitudinal state. Shallow water effects are integral to this model, so `water_depth` is a **required** parameter.

> **Note on speed behavior (`U_0`)**  
> The Abkowitz formulation is calibrated around a **reference speed** `U_0` (see vessel coefficients). Internally, surge-related terms are evaluated using the deviation `du = u - U_0`, so the model is typically most reliable when the simulated surge speed `u` stays reasonably close to `U_0`.  
> Unlike the MMG model, there is no explicit propulsion control input (`nps`) to command detailed acceleration/deceleration transients directly. As a result, precise speed-up/slow-down maneuvers (as modeled in MMG) are not directly represented in the same way.

```python
import math
from pymaneuvering import Vessel, VTYPE

# 1. Initialize an Abkowitz model (e.g., GMS-like Inland Barge)
vessel_type = VTYPE.GMS_LIKE
vessel = Vessel(new_from=vessel_type)

# 2. Set initial state
pos = [0.0, 0.0]
psi = 0.0
uvr = [2.5, 0.0, 0.0]  # Surge velocity drives the vessel

# 3. Simulate one step
new_uvr, new_eta = vessel.pstep(
    X=uvr,
    pos=pos,
    dT=1.0,
    delta=20 * (math.pi/180), # Rudder angle [rad]
    psi=psi,
    water_depth=3.5,        # Water depth [m] (REQUIRED for Abkowitz)
    # nps is NOT used here
    # w_vel (Wind) is NOT supported here
    fl_vel=0.5,             # Optional: Current speed [m/s]
    fl_psi=math.pi/2        # Optional: Current direction [rad]
)
```

| **Current** | ✅ Supported (`fl_vel`, `fl_psi`) | ✅ Supported (`fl_vel`, `fl_psi`) |

## Advanced Usage

### Dynamics (`step` vs `pstep`)

*   **`pstep(...)`**: **(Recommended)** "Position Step". inputs current state, position, and controls. Returns **updated state** (new `uvr`) and **updated position** (new `eta`). Handles coordinate transformation (vessel -> earth fixed) internally.
*   **`step(...)`**: "Dynamics Step". inputs current state and controls. Returns **accelerations/derivatives** (`u_dot`, `v_dot`, `r_dot`). Useful if you want to implement your own integration scheme (e.g., Runge-Kutta).

### Custom Calibration

You can calibrate custom MMG vessels using the `mmgdynamics.mmg.dynamics.calibrate` function with a `MinimalVessel` dictionary. See `src/mmg/dynamics.py` for details. Abkowitz models currently rely on pre-defined coefficient sets (like `gms_like_inland_barge`).
